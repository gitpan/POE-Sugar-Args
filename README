NAME
    POE::Sugar::Args - Get "pretty", OO representation of args.

SYNOPSIS
     use POE::Sugar::Args;

     sub _start {
       my $poe = sweeten_args;
       $poe->kernel->yield( '_stop' );
     }

     # or, the long, boring way
 
     sub _stop {
       my $poe = POE::Sugar::Args->new( @_ );
       delete $poe->heap->{client};
     }

ABSTRACT
    This module give an OO representation to arguments POE passes to event
    states. I will not lie to you. This adds heavy, bulky code underneath.
    On the other hand, it makes arguments for POE events much more
    palatable. Of course, this is a Sugar module, meaning, it will rot your
    program in odd (you'll be hooked) and unexpected ways (performace), but
    you took the candy so you can suffer the consequences. Good luck.

DESCRIPTION
  Exports

    This function will get "@_" from the calling state by doing deep, dark
    voodoo. It will construct the "POE::Sugar::Args" object for you. Very
    handy.

  Methods

   new

    Constructs an object. Expects all of "@_" that's passed to an event
    state.

   object

    If this state was initialized as an "object_state" in the session, the
    object will be here.

   session

    POE::Session object.

   kernel

    POE::Kernel object.

   heap

    Your heap.

   state

    Event name that invoked the state.

   sender

    Reference to the session that send the event.

   caller_file

    The calling file.

   caller_line

    The calling line.

   args

    All arguments this event was called with.
